# DSA210 Term Project

## Overview
I am Yağmur Geçim, a student at Sabancı University, and this repository contains my DSA210 term project. The objective of this project is to analyze the interaction and correlation between my daily mood, last two meals, and wake-up time on my fitness performance. Specifically, I aim to determine whether these factors influence my ability to lift heavier weights or whether I experience a decrease in strength on a given day.

## Hypotheses
This study tests the following hypotheses:

1. *Mood and Fitness Performance:* My mood may have a direct impact on my strength levels, with positive moods correlating with improved performance and negative moods correlating with reduced strength.
2. *Wake-Up Time and Fitness Performance:* A later wake-up time might result in decreased performance due to potential disruptions in my circadian rhythm and energy levels.
3. *Pre-Sport Meals and Fitness Performance:* The nutritional composition of my last two meals before exercise may influence my energy levels, endurance, and strength performance.

## Motivation
Fitness performance is influenced by various physiological and psychological factors, including sleep, nutrition, and mental well-being. Understanding the correlation between my mood, last two meals, and wake-up time on my workout performance may help optimize my fitness routine and improve strength gains. By analyzing self-collected data, this study aims to:

- Examine the relationship between mood and fitness performance.
- Investigate how wake-up time affects my strength and endurance during workouts.
- Assess the impact of pre-sport meals on my energy levels and workout performance.
- Identify patterns that could help optimize my training schedule and recovery.

## Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to uncover patterns in my fitness performance based on my mood, last two meals, and wake-up time. By leveraging data from the Samsung Health app (including sleep hours, social media activity, and mood tracking) and manually recorded workout details, this study aims to provide insights into how these factors influence my strength training progress.

## Data Sources and Preprocessing
The dataset used in this study is collected from the *Samsung Health app* and personal workout logs, providing the following metrics:

- *Mood Tracker:* Self-reported mood rating (on a scale from 1 to 5) recorded at the end of each day.
- *Wake-Up Time:* The exact time I wake up each day.
- *Pre-Sport Meals:* The last two meals before a workout, including their nutritional breakdown.
- *Fitness Performance:* Weight lifted during workouts, endurance levels, and perceived strength (whether I felt stronger or weaker compared to previous sessions).

The data will be cleaned and processed to ensure consistency and accuracy before conducting the analysis.

## Next Steps
The project will proceed with data analysis, hypothesis testing, and the application of machine learning techniques to uncover patterns and insights. Future work may include expanding the dataset, incorporating additional variables, and refining the analysis to enhance predictive accuracy.
