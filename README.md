# Analysis of the Relationship Between Game Prices and Player Ratings: A Study on Steam and Metacritic Data

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the relationship between game prices and user ratings on the Steam and Metacritic platforms. By utilizing publicly available data, we seek to determine whether a game's price influences its player ratings and explore additional factors that may impact this relationship.

### Key Research Questions:
➡ *Does a game's price affect its player ratings?*  
➡ *Do factors such as genre and release year modify this relationship?*  
➡ *Is there a difference between Steam user ratings and Metacritic scores?*  

## Research Objectives
This project will investigate the following questions:
- Is there a significant correlation between game price and player rating?
- How does this relationship vary across different game genres (e.g., Action, Indie, RPG)?
- Has this correlation changed over time (e.g., games released after 2020 vs. older games)?
- Are there rating differences between free-to-play and paid games?
- Does a game’s price correlate with the number of reviews it has received?
- How do Steam user ratings compare with Metacritic critic and user scores?
