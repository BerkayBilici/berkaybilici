# Analysis of the Relationship Between Game Prices and Player Ratings: A Study on Steam and Metacritic Data

## Overview
## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the relationship between game prices and player ratings on Steam and Metacritic. With the growing number of games released each year, understanding how price affects user perception has become an interesting question for both players and developers. By exploring data such as game prices, genres, release years, and user scores, this research aims to uncover whether higher-priced games tend to receive better ratings and how other factors like genre or release date influence this relationship. Additionally, comparing Steam and Metacritic ratings will help highlight any differences between user and critic reviews.

### Key Research Questions:
➡ *Does a game's price affect its player ratings?*  
➡ *Do factors such as genre and release year modify this relationship?*  
➡ *Is there a difference between Steam user ratings and Metacritic scores?*  

## Research Objectives
This project will investigate the following questions:
- Is there a significant correlation between game price and player rating?
- How does this relationship vary across different game genres (e.g., Action, Indie, RPG)?
- Has this correlation changed over time (e.g., games released after 2020 vs. older games)?
- Are there rating differences between free-to-play and paid games?
- Does a game’s price correlate with the number of reviews it has received?
- How do Steam user ratings compare with Metacritic critic and user scores?
## Motivation
I chose this project because I am genuinely interested in Steam games and curious about whether a game’s price influences key statistics such as user ratings and review counts. Through this research, I aim to explore how pricing might affect user engagement and perception on gaming platforms. Additionally, this project gives me an opportunity to improve my data analysis skills by working with real-world datasets and learning how to collect and utilize open-source data efficiently.
